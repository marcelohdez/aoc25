Advent of Code 2025 in Golang.

## Running

```bash
go run . <DAY> [FILES...]
```

When the above command is run, the day's solution function will be run once for
each `.txt` file in the respective folder.

However, if any optional `FILES` are passed in, it will run those for the given
day instead.
